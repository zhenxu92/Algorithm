 * Minimum Spanning Tree Kruskal Algorithm  v 1.0
 * @author zhenxu
 *
 * This program use Kruskal Algorithm to find the minimum
 * spanning tree in a graph. The algorithm is pretty straightforward
 * in that it just sort the edges by weight, then choose from the lowest
 * weighted edges, put it in the tree and check if there is a circle using 
 * union-find structure.
